# Guidelines

Welcome to the collaboration guide for Vortx. This document serves as a reference for how we work, collaborate, manage our codebase, and ensure a smooth development workflow. From committing code to resolving conflicts, this guide covers all the essential processes that keep our team aligned and our codebase clean and stable.

## Collaboration Overview

At Vortx, we follow a structured and efficient workflow to ensure high-quality code and seamless collaboration. This includes standardized processes for making commits, handling pull requests, reviewing code, and merging changes. We use Git and GitHub extensively, combined with tools like JIRA for task management and CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

In additions, we have established security best practices to safeguard our open-source projects, ensuring that sensitive data is handled securely and that we follow industry standards in protecting our codebase.
